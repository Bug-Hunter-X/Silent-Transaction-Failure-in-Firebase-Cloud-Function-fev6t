# Silent Transaction Failure in Firebase Cloud Functions

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error scenario in Firebase Cloud Functions involving silent transaction failures due to concurrent document modifications.  The provided code showcases the issue and includes a solution implementing robust error handling and retries.

## Problem

A Cloud Function attempts to update a document using a transaction. However, if another client modifies the document concurrently, the transaction might fail silently without throwing an error. This can lead to data inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior.  The original code lacks the proper mechanisms to detect and handle these conflicts. 

## Solution

The improved code includes comprehensive error handling. It explicitly checks for transaction errors and implements exponential backoff retry logic to gracefully handle concurrent modifications. This ensures data integrity and prevents silent failures.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Deploy the Cloud Function: `firebase deploy --only functions`
4. Test the function by triggering it.
